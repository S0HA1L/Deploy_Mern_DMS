        <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
        <p>
            An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath the
            earth’s
            surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. While they can happen anywhere
            without
            warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes include Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico,
            Washington and
            the entire Mississippi River Valley.
        </p>
        <h3>Prepare Before an Earthquake</h3>
        <h3>The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with family and coworkers.</li>
            <li>Include non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case services are cut
                off in your area.
                If you are able to, set aside items like soap, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol,
                disinfecting
                wipes, and general household cleaning supplies that you can use to disinfect surfaces you touch
                regularly. After an
                earthquake, you may not have access to these supplies for days or even weeks.</li>
            <li>Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home,
                alleviating the
                burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.</li>
            <li>Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford
                it, making
                essential purchases and slowly building up supplies in advance will allow for longer time periods
                between shopping
                trips. This helps to protect those who are unable to procure essentials in advance of the pandemic and
                must shop more
                frequently. In addition, consider avoiding WIC-labeled products so that those who rely on these products
                can access
                them.</li>
            <li>Protect Your Home: Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, televisions and
                objects that hang on
                walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves. Consider making improvements to your building
                to fix structural
                issues that could cause your building to collapse during an earthquake. Consider obtaining an earthquake
                insurance
                policy. A standard homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover earthquake damage.</li>
            <li>Wear a mask when in public to slow the spread of COVID-19. You may not have time to put on a mask in the
                event of an
                earthquake. Wearing one regularly will allow you to be prepared to drop, cover, and hold on safely with
                those who are
                not a part of your household. Masks should not be worn by children under two, those who have trouble
                breathing, and
                those who are unable to remove them on their own.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stay Safe During</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If an earthquake happens, protect yourself right away:</li>
            <li>If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.</li>
            <li>If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.</li>
            <li>If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Protect Yourself During Earthquakes</h3>
        <h3>1. Drop (or Lock)</h3>
        <p>Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. If you’re using a
            wheelchair or
            walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.</p>
        <h3>2. Cover</h3>
        <p>Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it for
            shelter. If no
            shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows). Crawl only if you can reach better
            cover without
            going through an area with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to protect vital organs.</p>
        <h3>3. Hold On</h3>
        <p>If you are under a table or desk, hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves. If seated
            and unable
            to drop to the floor, bend forward, cover your head with your arms and hold on to your neck with both hands.
        </p>
        <h3>Stay Safe After</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                After an earthquake, there can be serious hazards such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water
                lines, or downed
                power lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wash your hands with soap and water after holding on to commonly touched surfaces or objects. If you are
                unable to wash
                your hands, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.
            </li>
            <li>
                Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if
                you feel an
                aftershock.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. Do not enter
                damaged buildings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you are safe, pay attention to local news reports for emergency information and instructions via
            battery-operated
            radio, TV, social media or from cell phone text alerts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use text messages to communicate, which may be more reliable than phone calls.
            </li>
            <li>Be careful when cleaning up. Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work
                gloves and
                sturdy thick-soled shoes. Do not try to remove heavy debris by yourself. Wear a mask and maintain a
                physical distance of
                at least six feet while working with someone else. Use an appropriate mask if cleaning mold or other
                debris. People with
                asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water
                leaks or mold
                growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work.
