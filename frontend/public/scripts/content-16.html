        <h3>Nuclear Explosion</h3>
        <p>Nuclear explosions can cause significant damage and casualties from blast, heat, and radiation but you can
            keep your
            family safe by knowing what to do and being prepared if it occurs.</p>
        <p>A nuclear weapon is a device that uses a nuclear reaction to create an explosion.</p>
        <p>Nuclear devices range from a small portable device carried by an individual to a weapon carried by a missile.
        </p>
        <p>A nuclear explosion may occur with or without a few minutes warning.</p>
        <p>Fallout is most dangerous in the first few hours after the detonation when it is giving off the highest
            levels of
            radiation. It takes time for fallout to arrive back to ground level, often more than 15 minutes for areas
            outside of the
            immediate blast damage zones. This is enough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation
            exposure by
            following these simple steps:</p>
        <h3>GET INSIDE</h3>
        <p>Get inside the nearest building to avoid radiation. Brick or concrete are best.</p>
        <p>Remove contaminated clothing and wipe off or wash unprotected skin if you were outside after the fallout
            arrived. Hand
            sanitizer does not protect against fall out. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, if possible. Do not
            use
            disinfectant wipes on your skin.</p>
        <p>Go to the basement or middle of the building. Stay away from the outer walls and roof. Try to maintain a
            distance of at
            least six feet between yourself and people who are not part of your household. If possible, wear a mask if
            you’re
            sheltering with people who are not a part of your household. Children under two years old, people who have
            trouble
            breathing, and those who are unable to remove masks on their own should not wear them.</p>
        <h3>STAY INSIDE
        </h3>
        <p>Stay inside for 24 hours unless local authorities provide other instructions. Continue to practice social
            distancing by
            wearing a mask and by keeping a distance of at least six feet between yourself and people who not part of
            your
            household.</p>
        <p>Family should stay where they are inside. Reunite later to avoid exposure to dangerous radiation.</p>
        <h3>STAY TUNED</h3>
        <p>Tune into any media available for official information such as when it is safe to exit and where you should
            go.</p>
        <p>Battery operated and hand crank radios will function after a nuclear detonation.</p>
        <p>Cell phone, text messaging, television, and internet services may be disrupted or unavailable.</p>
        <p>HOW TO STAY SAFE IN THE EVENT OF A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION</p>
        <h3>Survive DURING</h3>
        <p>If warned of an imminent attack, immediately get inside the nearest building and move away from windows. This
            will help
            provide protection from the blast, heat, and radiation of the detonation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you have reached a safe place, try to maintain a distance of at least six feet between yourself and
                people who are
                not part of your household. If possible, wear a mask if you’re sheltering with people who are not a part
                of your
                household. Children under two years old, people who have trouble breathing, and those who are unable to
                remove masks on
                their own should not wear them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the shock wave passes, get inside the nearest, best shelter location for protection from potential
            fallout. You
            will have 10 minutes or more to find an adequate shelter.</p>
        <p>Be inside before the fallout arrives. The highest outdoor radiation levels from fallout occur immediately
            after the
            fallout arrives and then decrease with time.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for updated instructions from emergency response officials. If advised to evacuate, listen for
            information
            about routes, shelters, and procedures.
        </p>
        <h3>Be Safe AFTER
        </h3>
        <p>Immediately after you are inside shelter, if you may have been outside after the fallout arrived.</p>
        <p>Remove your outer layer of contaminated clothing to remove fallout and radiation from your body. Avoid
            touching your
            eyes, nose, and mouth, if possible.</p>
        <p>Clean any pets that were outside after the fallout arrived. Gently brush your pet’s coat to remove any
            fallout particles
            and wash your pet with soap and water, if available.</p>
        <p>It is safe to eat or drink packaged food items or items that were inside a building. Do not consume food or
            liquids that
            were outdoors uncovered and may be contaminated by fallout.</p>

        <h3>Hazards related to nuclear explosions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bright FLASH can cause temporary blindness for less than a minute.</li>
            <li>BLAST WAVE can cause death, injury, and damage to structures several miles out from the blast.
            </li>
            <li>RADIATION can damage cells of the body. Large exposures can cause radiation sickness.</li>
            <li>FIRE AND HEAT can cause death, burn injuries, and damage to structures several miles out.</li>
            <li>ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) can damage electrical power equipment and electronics several miles out from
                the detonation
                and cause temporary disruptions further out.</li>
            <li>FALLOUT is radioactive, visible dirt and debris raining down from several miles up that can cause
                sickness to those who
                are outside.</li>
        </ul>
