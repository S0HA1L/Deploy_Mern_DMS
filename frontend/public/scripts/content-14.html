        <h3>Hurricanes</h3>
        <h3>Hurricanes in Your Language</h3>
        <p>Hurricanes are dangerous and can cause major damage because of storm surge, wind damage, rip currents and
            flooding. They
            can happen along any India coast or in any territory in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans. Storm surge is
            historically the
            leading cause of hurricane-related deaths in the India.</p>
        <h3>Prepare for Hurricanes</h3>
        <h3>Know your Hurricane Risk</h3>
        <p>Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, water, even tornadoes could happen far
            inland from
            where a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall. Start preparing now.</p>
        <h3>Those with Disabilities</h3>
        <p>If you or anyone in your household is an individual with a disability identify if you may need additional
            help during an
            emergency.</p>
        <h3>Make an Emergency Plan</h3>
        <p>Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands your hurricane plan. In your hurricane plans
            include the
            office, kids’ daycare, and anywhere you frequent. Ensure your business has a continuity plan to continue
            operating when
            disaster strikes.

            Discuss the latest Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance on Coronavirus (COVID-19) and how it may
            affect your
            hurricane planning.</p>
        <h3>Review Important Documents</h3>
        <p>Make sure your insurance policies and personal documents like ID are up to date. Make copies and keep them in
            a secure
            password protected digital space.</p>
        <h3>Strengthen your Home</h3>
        <p>De-clutter drains and gutters, bring in outside furniture, consider hurricane shutters.</p>
        <h3>Stay Safe During a Hurricane</h3>
        <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay attention to emergency information and alerts.</li>
            <li>If you live in a mandatory evacuation zone and local officials tell you to evacuate, do so immediately.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dealing with the Weather</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine how best to protect yourself from high winds and flooding.</li>
            <li>Take refuge in a designated storm shelter, or an interior room for high winds.
            </li>
            <li>If trapped in a building by flooding, go to the highest level of the building. Do not climb into a
                closed attic. You may
                become trapped by rising flood water.</li>
            <li>Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! Just six inches of
                fast-moving water can
                knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>feature_mini img
            Personal Safety</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you must go to a community or group shelter remember to follow the latest recommendations from the
                Centers for
                Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for protecting yourself and family from COVID-19. Be sure to review
                your previous
                evacuation plan and consider alternative options to maintain physical distancing to prevent the spread
                of COVID-19 and
                update your plan accordingly.</li>
            <li>If you must evacuate, if possible, bring with you items that can help protect you and others in the
                shelter from
                COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer, cleaning materials, and two clean, well-fitted masks that have two or
                more layers for
                each person.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Returning Home After a Hurricane</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay attention to local officials for information and special instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Be careful during clean-up. Wear protective clothing, use appropriate face coverings or masks if
                cleaning mold or other
                debris, and maintain a physical distance of at least six feet while working with someone else. People
                with asthma and
                other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or
                mold growth that
                can be seen or smelled, even if they do not have an allergy to mold. Children should not take part in
                disaster cleanup
                work.</li>
            <li>Continue taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, such as washing
                your hands often
                and cleaning commonly touched surfaces.</li>
            <li>Wear protective clothing and work with someone else.</li>
            <li>Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so,
                turn off
                electricity at the main breaker or fuse box to prevent electric shock.</li>
            <li>Do not wade in flood water, which can contain dangerous pathogens that cause illnesses, debris,
                chemicals, waste and
                wildlife. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.</li>
            <li>Save phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems are often down or busy after a disaster. Use text
                messages or social
                media to communicate with family and friends.</li>
            <li>Document any property damage with photographs. Contact your insurance company for assistance.</li>
            <li>Engage virtually with your community through video and phone calls. Know that it’s normal to feel
                anxious or stressed.
                Take care of your body and talk to someone if you are feeling upset. Many people may already feel fear
                and anxiety about
                the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The threat of a hurricane can add additional stress. Follow CDC
                guidance for managing
                stress during a traumatic event and managing stress during COVID-19.</li>
